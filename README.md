# ES6+

It's the conclusion of **8th chapter** (there's **20**) of [devmentor.pl](https://devmentor.pl/mentoring-javascript) mentoring program.

## How to check it out:

1) fetch the project.
2) clone it on your pc.
3) use *npm install* to install the required packages. (**make sure you're in the root directory**).
4) use *npm run start* to launch the project.

#### Check .js files:

./README-assets/oldScript.js - **file to refactor**

./assets/js/script.js
./assets/js/modules/JSSlider.js

---

## :memo: Tasks:

1) Refactor the existing code to conform to **ES6** standards.
2) Create a **JSSlider** class and integrate it into the main *script.js* file through **import statements**.
3) Use the following **ES6** methodologies:

- Destructuring Assignment
- Spread Operator
- Arrow Functions
- Template Literals

4) Maintain the **Single Responsibility Principle** to ensure each module or function has a specific, focused purpose.
5) Use **Babel** to ensure compatibility with browsers updated since 2016, targeting those with at least 1% market share.
